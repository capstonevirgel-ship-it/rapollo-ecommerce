# Gay Hello Booking Management System

An inclusive, privacy-conscious booking platform designed for LGBTQ+ communities, venues, and service providers. It helps venues and organizers publish availability and events, and enables guests to discover, book, and manage reservations with safety and respect at the core.

## Why this exists
Many booking tools overlook inclusivity, safety, and privacy needs. This system centers those needs by design: respectful onboarding, clear safety controls, anonymous options where possible, and strong moderation tools.

## Core features (MVP)
- Venue and service management: profiles, amenities, policies, photos
- Availability & scheduling: time slots, blackout dates, capacity rules
- Booking flow: search, book, modify, cancel; email/SMS notifications
- Roles & permissions: admin, venue owner, staff, guest
- Payments (optional): Stripe integration with refunds and payouts
- Messaging: guest ↔ venue secure messaging with moderation controls
- Reviews & ratings: post-stay feedback and dispute workflows
- Analytics: basic dashboards for occupancy, revenue, and trends
- Accessibility & localization: WCAG-minded UI, i18n-ready copy
- Safety & privacy: content moderation, incident reporting, data minimization

## Tech stack (initial proposal)
- API: REST or GraphQL (stack TBD)
- Database: PostgreSQL (recommended), alternative adapters supported later
- Web app: modern SPA/SSR framework (TBD)
- Auth: email + password, OAuth (optional), session or JWT
- Payments: Stripe (optional)

You can adjust these choices as implementation progresses.

## Getting started (local)
1. Clone the repository
2. Create environment file
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if `.env.example` is missing, create `.env` and add the variables below)
3. Install dependencies
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm install` or `pnpm install` or `yarn`
4. Database setup (if using PostgreSQL)
   - Ensure the database exists and `DATABASE_URL` is set
   - Run migrations: your framework’s migrate command (e.g., `npm run db:migrate`)
5. Start the app
   - Dev: `npm run dev`
   - Prod: `npm run build && npm run start`
6. Open the app
   - Visit http://localhost:3000 (or the port your app uses)

## Environment variables (examples)
- APP_URL: base URL of the app (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
- SESSION_SECRET or JWT_SECRET: long, random secret
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: if payments are enabled
- SMTP_...: if email is enabled

## High-level domain model
- User: account, roles, preferences, safety settings
- Venue: profile, location, policies, images
- Service/Event: bookable item (room, ticket, session)
- Availability: rules and time slots
- Booking: status lifecycle (pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled)
- Payment: charges, refunds, payouts (optional)
- Review: ratings, comments, moderation state
- Message: secure conversation between guest and venue

## Roadmap
- MVP release: core booking, roles, availability, notifications
- Accessibility audit and improvements
- Privacy tools: export/delete data, anonymized analytics
- Mobile-friendly responsive UI
- Multi-tenant and marketplace features
- Expanded moderation and safety workflows
